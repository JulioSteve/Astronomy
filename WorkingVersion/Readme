The three ".f95" files are part of the same program (N-body program).
In the "settings.f95" file, some parameters can be changed.

The "pos.dat" file contains initial positions of 2000 particles. It can be used in the program if "use_init_file" is set to ".true." in "settings.f95".

The "speed.bash" file is a bash code that execute 10 times the program for a given range of threads. It save the execution time of the program in 10 files, where each file contains the execution time for a given nmber of threads.

A Makefile is provided to compile the program using the command "make"

The folder "output" will be fill with files when the N-body program will be executed. This folder is here (but empty) to avoid any arror.
The folder "gif_data" will be fill with images used to create the animation (GIF) by the "plot_evo.py" python code. This folder is here (but empty) to avoid any arror.

To avoid any strange results, please delete the old "pos.bin" file in the "output" folder before each time you run the N-body program.
